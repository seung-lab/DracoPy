# DracoPy

DracoPy is a Python wrapper for Google's Draco mesh compression library

Available as a PyPI package: pip install DracoPy 

DracoPy requires Python >= 3.5, pip >= 10, and a C++ compiler that is fully compatible with C++11.

It supports Linux and OS X. 

Windows installation is currently broken, and it is recommended that Windows users use the Windows Subsystem for Linux instead.

An example of usage is given in example.py.
